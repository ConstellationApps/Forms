Constellation Forms
===================


This module implements a forms system for creating, filling out, and
reviewing forms within an organization.  This module depends on the
Constellation-Base package to function correctly.

Constellation Forms implements a fairly standard forms system.  The
core features include:

* Click-to-Build form builder
* Form Lifecycles
* Form Versions

Advanced features are also available such as form approval and commenting.
These features can help support more advanced use cases where simply creating,
distributing, filing, and reading submissions is not a sufficient workflow.
