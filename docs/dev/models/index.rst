Database Models
===============

This section contains information on the database models and how the
datamodel is stored.

.. warning:: For reasons related to particular Django database models,
   only the PostgreSQL database is supported at this time.  If Django
   adds support for serializing the PostgreSQL JSONB field to a non
   engine specific type this restriction may be lifted in the future.
